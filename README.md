# [Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/reemaa-h/Data-Analysis/commit/ddc48229e5c1335e6010f876fa51549a176e6f2e)

This is a project I did for my data analysis course, where I built an interactive dashboard to analyze customer churn for a telecom company.

* Data was taken from DataCamp
* The dataset was cleaned by removing empty columns
* New calculations were created, including:  
  - Churn Rate 
  - Active Customers   
  - Churned Customers   
  - Age values were grouped into categories (Age Groups) for clearer visualization
  - The dashboard allows filtering by gender, payment method, and  contract type
